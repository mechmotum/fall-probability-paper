  abstract = {Bicycles are more difficult to control at low speeds due to the vehicle's unstable low-speed dynamics. This issue might be exacerbated by factors such as aging, disturbances, and multi-tasking. To address this issue, we developed a prototype `balance assist system' with Royal Dutch Gazelle and Bosch eBike Systems at Delft University of Technology, which includes an electric motor capable of providing additional steering torque. We implemented a speed-adaptive feedback controller to generate the additional steering torque to that of the rider. We conducted a study with 18 older and 14 younger cyclists to first examine the effect of aging, disturbances, and multi-tasking on cycling at lower forward speeds, and evaluate the effectiveness of the system in improving the stability of the rider-bicycle system while facing these challenges. The study consisted of two scenarios: a single-task scenario where participants rode the bicycle on a marked narrow straight-line track, and a multi-task scenario where participants performed a shoulder check task and followed visual cues while tracking the straight-line. We introduced handlebar disturbances using the steer motor in half of the trials in both scenarios. All trials were repeated with and without the balance assist system. We calculated the bicycle mean magnitude of roll and steering rate---as indicators of bicycle balance control and required steering actions, respectively---and the rider's mean magnitude of lean rate with respect to the ground to investigate the effect of the balance assist system on rider's lateral motion. Our results showed that aging, disturbances, and multi-tasking increased the roll rate, and the balance assist system was able to significantly reduce it. The effect size of the balance assist system in reducing the roll rate across all conditions was found to be larger in older cyclists, indicating a more substantial impact compared to younger cyclists. Disturbances and multi-tasking increased the steering rate, which was successfully reduced by the balance assist system. Aging did not significantly affect the steering rate. The rider's lean rate was not significantly affected by age, disturbances, or the balance assist, indicating that the upper body plays a minor role when riders have good steering control authority. Overall, our findings suggest that lateral motion and required steering action can be affected by age, multi-tasking, and handlebar disturbances which can endanger cyclists' safety, and the balance assist system has the potential to improve cycling safety and reduce the incidence of single-actor crashes. Further investigation on riders' contribution to control actions is required.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of the dynamical states of bicycles are crucial for many advanced rider assistance systems. However, systems that can provide an exact estimate of the system states (especially the system orientations) are often expensive and therefore cannot be used in mass production. In this work, a method is presented that estimates the dynamical states of a bicycle using measurements, provided by a cost-effective sensor configuration. The proposed method is based on a constrained extended Kalman filter and uses accelerometer, gyroscope and wheel speed measurements to estimate the vehicle dynamics. Since no bicycle model is required, the filter can be easily adapted for the use in a wide range of bicycles and other single-track vehicles like motorcycles. The filter is implemented on a rapid control prototyping platform and the results are compared to measurements of a reference sensor unit. Here, special attention is put on the roll angle and the velocity estimates, where the filter produces excellent results. In addition, the filter robustness to sensor errors and uncertain system parameters is evaluated.},

  abstract = {Single bicycle crashes, i.e., falls and impacts not involving a collision with another road user, are a significantly underestimated road safety problem. The motions and behaviours of falling people, or fall kinematics, are often investigated in the injury biomechanics research field. Understanding the mechanics of a fall can help researchers develop better protective gear and safety measures to reduce the risk of injury. However, little is known about cyclist fall kinematics or dynamics. Therefore, in this study, a video analysis of cyclist falls is performed to investigate common kinematic forms and impact patterns. Furthermore, a pipeline involving deep learning-based human pose estimation and inverse kinematics optimisation is created for extracting human motion from real-world footage of falls to initialise forward dynamics computational human body models. A bracing active response is then optimised for using a genetic algorithm. This is then applied to a case study of a cyclist fall. The kinematic forms characterised in this study can be used to inform initial conditions for computational modelling and injury estimation in cyclist falls. Findings indicate that protective response is an important consideration in fall kinematics and dynamics, and should be included in computational modelling. Furthermore, the novel reconstruction pipeline proposed here can be applied more broadly for traumatic injury biomechanics tasks.

The wheels are also axisymmetric and make ideal knife-edge rolling point contact with the ground level. The mass distribution and geometry are otherwise arbitrary. This conservative non-holonomic system has a seven-dimensional accessible configuration space and three velocity degrees of freedom parametrized by rates of frame lean, steer angle and rear wheel rotation. We construct the terms in the governing equations methodically for easy implementation. The equations are suitable for e.g. the study of bicycle self-stability. We derived these equations by hand in two ways and also checked them against two nonlinear dynamics simulations. In the century-old literature, several sets of equations fully agree with those here and several do not. Two benchmarks provide test cases for checking alternative formulations of the equations of motion or alternative numerical solutions. Further, the results here can also serve as a check for general purpose dynamic programs. For the benchmark bicycles, we accurately calculate the eigenvalues (the roots of the characteristic equation) and the speeds at which bicycle lean and steer are self-stable, confirming the century-old result that this conservative system can have asymptotic stability.},

  abstract = {After some brief history, a mathematical model of a bicycle that has become a benchmark is described. The symbolic equations of motion of the bicycle are given in two forms and the equations are interpreted, with special reference to stability. The mechanics of autostabilization are discussed in detail. The relationship between design and behavior is shown to be heavily speed-dependent and complex. Using optimal linear preview control theory, rider control of the bicycle is studied. It is shown that steering control by an optimal rider, especially at low speeds, is powerful in comparison with a bicycle's self-steering. This observation leads to the expectation that riders will be insensitive to variations in design, as has been observed in practice. Optimal preview speed control is also demonstrated. Extensions to the basic treatment of bicycle dynamics in the benchmark case are considered so that the modeling includes more realistic representations of tires, frames, and riders. The implications for stability predictions are discussed and it is shown that the moderate-speed behavior is altered little by the elaborations. Rider control theory is applied to the most realistic of the models considered and the results indicate a strong similarity between the benchmark case and the complex one, where they are directly comparable. In the complex case, steering control by rider-lean-torque is feasible and the results indicate that, when this is combined with steer-torque control, it is completely secondary. When only rider-lean-torque control is possible, extended preview is necessary, high-gain control is required, and the controls are relatively complex. Much that is known about the stability and control of bicycles is collected and explained, together with new material relating to modeling accuracy, bicycle design, and rider control.},

Laboratory-based perturbation systems have the capability of simulating various modes of fall-inducing perturbations in a repeatable way. These systems enable fundamental research on human gait and balance and facilitate the development of devices to assist human balance. We present a robotic, rope-driven system capable of rendering bumps and force-fields at a person's pelvis in any direction in the transverse plane with forces up to 200 N, and a 90\% rise time of as little as 44 ms, which is faster than a human's ability to sense and respond to the force. These capabilities enable experiments that require stabilizing or destabilizing subjects as they stand or walk on a treadmill. To facilitate use by researchers from all backgrounds, we designed both a configuration with simpler open-loop force control, and another with higher-performance, closed-loop force control. Both configurations are modular, and the open-loop system is made entirely from 3D-printed and catalog components.

  abstract = {Up to now, not much is known about how humans control bicycles, especially when subject to large perturbations. In order to learn more about the extent to which these perturbations can be handled, a new experimental setup is required, which can deliver large perturbations to cyclists and bring them to fall. This thesis describes the detailed design and evaluation of such a setup. Several requirements are formulated regarding different experiment aspects that the setup must adhere to. The proposed design consists of a treadmill on which a subject rides a bicycle. Ropes are guided from the ends of the bicycle's handlebar toward the front and back of the setup, where they are attached to four motor units of a robotic rope-pulling system. Based on a feed-forward conversion added with PI force feedback control, a shared controller commands the motors to maintain a tracking force or perturb the cyclist by applying a net torque on the handlebar for a short time. An active safety harness is the main feature that prevents the subject from harm. Meanwhile, motion capture recordings of strategically placed passive markers and data from inertial measurement units on the bicycle are collected. With appropriate processing, the angles and angular velocities that describe the dynamics and control of the bicycle-rider system can be obtained from these measurements. The force data is also collected, by the controller. Interesting results that can be obtained with this setup include the probabilities to fall after perturbations of variable forces and the data required to evaluate the equations of motions of the bicycle-rider system during and shortly after a perturbation. This can be used to provide a baseline against which future bicycles can be compared and it is useful for validating rider models. The experiment shows consistent performance and generates high quality measurements. Neither the 12 pilot participants nor the 26 subjects who participated in follow-up experiments encountered any safety issues. The experiment could even be improved by resolving issues regarding the motor behaviour and CPU overloads. The workload of the experiment operators could be decreased if intervention of the safety harness was trained on cycling and coupled to deactivation of the treadmill. A next step would be to automate the data processing by developing a classifier that distinguishes recoveries from falls.},

  abstract = {More than one third of all road deaths in the Netherlands and more than two thirds of seriously injured casualties are cyclists. In recent years these shares have increased, despite the fact that the implementation of Safe System principles has been leading in road safety policy and has been successful in reducing the total number of road deaths. However, the annual number of fatalities among cyclists failed to decline and the number of injuries among cyclists has been increasing, especially in single-bicycle crashes. This raises the question why until now Safe System implementation has failed to contribute to the reduction of the number of casualties among cyclists. This question is urgent because of the goal to reduce the number of road deaths and serious traffic injuries in the Netherlands to (virtually) ZERO by 2050. This ambition is in line with the objectives of the European Union. The causes of the unfavourable developments in road safety for cyclists in the Netherlands and which problems require a solution are examined. This raises two questions: can improved implementation of Safe System measures reverse the negative trend, and can this result in ZERO cycling casualties in the future. The discussion involves investigating three dimensions: exposure, crash risk, and injury risk. The opportunities that technological developments may offer in future decades are also considered. It is concluded that Safe System implementation will include opportunities to make cycling considerably safer in the Netherlands. However, we face too many uncertainties to allow for developing scenarios that show how close the Netherlands will be to ZERO cyclists casualties.},

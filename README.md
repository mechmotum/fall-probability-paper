- Don't commit binary objects (like pngs) yet, maybe we can set this up to
  build everything.
- Use booktabs for the table formatting
- Use natbib for variations on citations
- subcaption is available for subfigures
- Use siunitx for units (note the kph custom definition)
- Jason has a zotero folder with the references and auto generates the bib
  file from it. TOOD: Make a shared zotero folder so anyone can generate it.
  Don't edit the bib file manually (until possibly the very end of writing).

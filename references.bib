  abstract = {Appropriately centering Level 1 predictors is vital to the interpretation of intercept and slope parameters in multilevel models (MLMs). The issue of centering has been discussed in the literature, but it is still widely misunderstood. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed overview of grand mean centering and group mean centering in the context of 2-level MLMs. The authors begin with a basic overview of centering and explore the differences between grand and group mean centering in the context of some prototypical research questions. Empirical analyses of artificial data sets are used to illustrate key points throughout. The article provides a number of practical recommendations designed to facilitate centering decisions in MLM applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of the dynamical states of bicycles are crucial for many advanced rider assistance systems. However, systems that can provide an exact estimate of the system states (especially the system orientations) are often expensive and therefore cannot be used in mass production. In this work, a method is presented that estimates the dynamical states of a bicycle using measurements, provided by a cost-effective sensor configuration. The proposed method is based on a constrained extended Kalman filter and uses accelerometer, gyroscope and wheel speed measurements to estimate the vehicle dynamics. Since no bicycle model is required, the filter can be easily adapted for the use in a wide range of bicycles and other single-track vehicles like motorcycles. The filter is implemented on a rapid control prototyping platform and the results are compared to measurements of a reference sensor unit. Here, special attention is put on the roll angle and the velocity estimates, where the filter produces excellent results. In addition, the filter robustness to sensor errors and uncertain system parameters is evaluated.},

  abstract = {Fall-related injury is a significant health problem on a global scale and is expected to grow with the aging population. Laboratory-based perturbation systems have the capability of simulating various modes of fall-inducing perturbations in a repeatable way. These systems enable fundamental research on human gait and balance and facilitate the development of devices to assist human balance. We present a robotic, rope-driven system capable of rendering bumps and force-fields at a person's pelvis in any direction in the transverse plane with forces up to 200 N, and a 90\% rise time of as little as 44 ms, which is faster than a human's ability to sense and respond to the force. These capabilities enable experiments that require stabilizing or destabilizing subjects as they stand or walk on a treadmill. To facilitate use by researchers from all backgrounds, we designed both a configuration with simpler open-loop force control, and another with higher-performance, closed-loop force control. Both configurations are modular, and the open-loop system is made entirely from 3D-printed and catalog components. The design files and assembly instructions for both are freely available in an online repository.},

  abstract = {Up to now, not much is known about how humans control bicycles, especially when subject to large perturbations. In order to learn more about the extent to which these perturbations can be handled, a new experimental setup is required, which can deliver large perturbations to cyclists and bring them to fall. This thesis describes the detailed design and evaluation of such a setup. Several requirements are formulated regarding different experiment aspects that the setup must adhere to. The proposed design consists of a treadmill on which a subject rides a bicycle. Ropes are guided from the ends of the bicycle's handlebar toward the front and back of the setup, where they are attached to four motor units of a robotic rope-pulling system. Based on a feed-forward conversion added with PI force feedback control, a shared controller commands the motors to maintain a tracking force or perturb the cyclist by applying a net torque on the handlebar for a short time. An active safety harness is the main feature that prevents the subject from harm. Meanwhile, motion capture recordings of strategically placed passive markers and data from inertial measurement units on the bicycle are collected. With appropriate processing, the angles and angular velocities that describe the dynamics and control of the bicycle-rider system can be obtained from these measurements. The force data is also collected, by the controller. Interesting results that can be obtained with this setup include the probabilities to fall after perturbations of variable forces and the data required to evaluate the equations of motions of the bicycle-rider system during and shortly after a perturbation. This can be used to provide a baseline against which future bicycles can be compared and it is useful for validating rider models. The experiment shows consistent performance and generates high quality measurements. Neither the 12 pilot participants nor the 26 subjects who participated in follow-up experiments encountered any safety issues. The experiment could even be improved by resolving issues regarding the motor behaviour and CPU overloads. The workload of the experiment operators could be decreased if intervention of the safety harness was trained on cycling and coupled to deactivation of the treadmill. A next step would be to automate the data processing by developing a classifier that distinguishes recoveries from falls.},

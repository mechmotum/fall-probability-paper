<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Single-actor bicycle crashes are associated with a surprisingly large
percentage of reported serious injuries in The Netherlands (&gt;80%) and
values range between 50% and 95% in other surveyed countries <span
class="citation" data-cites="Wegman2024">(Wegman and Schepers
2024)</span>. Utriainen, O’Hern, and Pöllänen <span class="citation"
data-cites="Utriainen2023">(Utriainen, O’Hern, and Pöllänen 2023)</span>
report that slippery surfaces, simple loss of control, and engagement
with a curb, pothole, or bollard are the most common fall types in the
seven reported countries. Most of these types involve perturbations that
result in loss of balance. At low speeds, from start up to typical
cruising speeds, bicycles are not self-stable and can be challenging for
the rider to balance. Low speed crashes may be reduced if the bicycle
was self-stable at these speeds by relieving the rider of some of their
necessary control activity. Bicycles can be mechanically modified to
lower the speeds at which they are self-stable <span class="citation"
data-cites="Astrom2005">(Åström, Klein, and Lennartsson 2005)</span> and
since the 1980s it has been known that applying a motor actuated
steering torque proportional to the vehicle’s roll angular rate <a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> can stabilize a single-track vehicle
down to very low speeds <span class="citation"
data-cites="Ruijs1986">(Ruijs and Pacejka 1986)</span>. If automatic
control of steering can stabilize a bicycle, it may reduce the control
required from the rider to successfully manage balancing tasks much like
natural high speed self-stability already does. We have developed a
balance-assisting bicycle, Figure <a href="#fig:balance-assist-bicycle"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:balance-assist-bicycle">1</a>, based on these
principles and hypothesize that it helps the rider in situations in
which they are likely to fall.</p>

<p>Riders fall when their control authority is not sufficient to
maintain a stable vehicle state. There are many real world scenarios
that can put the vehicle into an uncontrollable state. External forces
applied to the vehicle or rider are one such scenario type and natural
examples include wind gusts, handlebars colliding with a neighbor’s, a
bag swinging from the handlebar, or simply hitting a bump in the road.
To assess our balance assisting bicycle, we subject the rider to
perturbations at the handlebar, which can easily cause a rider to fall.
From a mechanics perspective, it is not particularly important how or
where the perturbation is applied but that it results in forcing the
bicycle-rider system into an unrecoverable state, as all forces acting
on a dynamical system can be resolved into an equivalent force and
torque of a couple at any location in the system <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kane1985">(Kane and David A. Levinson 1985)</span>. We chose
to perturb the handlebar because of this superposition principle,
because it was practical, and because it required a low force to cause a
fall.</p>
<p>In this paper <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, we investigate whether an
automatically controlled bicycle, that is stable in a large low speed
range for balance assist, is beneficial in helping to prevent the rider
from falling. We test this possible benefit by applying varying
magnitude mechanical perturbations to the handlebars while the rider is
cycling on a treadmill. We assess the difference in the rider’s
probability of falling with the balance assist system on and off.</p>
<h2 id="technical-background">Technical Background</h2>
<p>During the early years of developments in automatic control,
Whipple <span class="citation" data-cites="Whipple1899">(Whipple
1899)</span> not only derived the correct equations of motion of the
bicycle <span class="citation" data-cites="Meijaard2007">(Meijaard et
al. 2007)</span> but realized and showed that roll motion feedback can
stabilize a bicycle. Much later, attempts at automatic roll
stabilization of single-track vehicles began in earnest after predictive
motorcycle models were developed and refined throughout the 1970s. Van
Zytveld <span class="citation" data-cites="vanZytveld1975">(van Zytveld
1975)</span> was influenced by Whipple’s work and seems to be the first
to attempt to robotically stabilize a small motorbike with a controlled
inverted pendulum that mimicked rider lean, but he was not successful in
demonstrating what his theoretic control model correctly predicted. In
his model, he recognized that feedback of the vehicle roll angle and
angular rate was essential to stabilize the vehicle. It was not until
the early 1980s that Nagai <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nagai1983">(Nagai 1983)</span> successfully demonstrated
balancing a robotic bicycle on a treadmill with both steering control
and a laterally moving mass. Ruijs and Pacejka <span class="citation"
data-cites="Ruijs1986">(Ruijs and Pacejka 1986)</span> followed this
breakthrough by demonstrating an automatically balanced motorcycle and
they did so solely with a steering motor. Ruijs and Pacejka showed that
steer torque driven by roll angle feedback stabilizes the capsize mode,
by roll angular rate feedback stabilizes the weave mode, and by steer
angular rate feedback stabilizes the wobble mode. <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
They also showed how the control gains must change with respect to
vehicle speed for favorable control across all speeds. Thus roll motion
feedback enables the simplest controller that can stabilize a
single-track vehicle above a minimum speed when one is not concerned
with wobble instabilities. But Ruijs and Pacejka’s work was not
particularly concerned with low speed stability and their vehicle was
fully automatic, i.e no human rider was involved.</p>
<p>Many more automatically balanced single-track vehicles have been
demonstrated over the last 40 years, but none have demonstrated that
increasing low speed stability can assist in human balancing and what
effect it may have towards single-actor falls. Most of these robotic
bicycle and motorcycle designers did not intend for a human rider to
also control the stabilized vehicle. Nevertheless, an automatically
stabilized bicycle can be controlled by a human rider if the motor
controlled steer torque and the rider applied steer torque act in
parallel. This automatic control provides the ability to effectively
change the human-controlled plant dynamics, up to some limits. In our
prior study <span class="citation"
data-cites="Alizadehsaravi2023">(Alizadehsaravi and Moore 2023)</span>,
we demonstrated reduced motion during distractions and light
perturbations due to the balance assist system but Hanakam, Wehner, and
Wrede <span class="citation" data-cites="Hanakam2023">(Hanakam, Wehner,
and Wrede 2023)</span> recently showed rider dissatisfaction with the
stabilization of a similar vehicle. So, the overall possible benefits
are not yet definitively established.</p>
<p>The design of our balance assist system relies on the linear
Carvallo-Whipple bicycle model <span class="citation"
data-cites="Carvallo1899 Whipple1899">(Carvallo 1899; Whipple
1899)</span> which is the simplest bicycle model that exhibits both the
non-minimum phase behavior “countersteering” and self-stability. The
bicycle model is well suited for showing the effect of a roll motion
feedback driven steer motor on the dynamics. This model is equivalently
valid for on-road or treadmill riding <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kooijman2009a">(Kooijman and Schwab 2009)</span>, which have
the same fundamental dynamics. The linear version of this model can be
described by the fourth order state space equations: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \dot{\vec{x}} = \mathbf{A} \vec{x} +
  \mathbf{B}
  \vec{u}
  \textrm{ where }
  \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} \phi \\ \dot{\phi} \\ \delta \\ \dot{\delta}
\end{bmatrix}
  \textrm{ and }
  \vec{u} = \begin{bmatrix} T_{\phi} \\ T_{\delta} \end{bmatrix}
  \textrm{.}
\end{aligned}\]</span> The states <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{x}\)</span> are the roll angle <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> and steer angle <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> along with their time derivatives
and the inputs <span class="math inline">\(\vec{u}\)</span> are roll
torque <span class="math inline">\(T_\phi\)</span> and steer torque
<span class="math inline">\(T_\delta\)</span> as defined in  <span
class="citation" data-cites="Meijaard2007">(Meijaard et al.
2007)</span>. The state matrix <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is a function of the
equilibrium forward speed <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. It and
the input matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> are
otherwise populated with expressions that are functions of the geometric
and inertial parameters of the nonholonomic multibody system made up of
four rigid bodies: two wheels, front frame, and rear frame.</p>
<p>If the steer torque is the sum of the (h)uman applied torque and the
(m)otor applied torque <span class="math inline">\(T_\delta =
T_\delta^\textrm{h} + T_\delta^\textrm{m}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{B}_\phi \quad
\vec{B}_\delta
\end{bmatrix}\)</span>, and the motor torque is a proportional feedback
controller <span class="math inline">\(T_\delta^\textrm{m} =
-k_{\dot{\phi}} \dot{\phi}\)</span> then the human-controlled plant
takes the form: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \dot{\vec{x}} = \left(\mathbf{A} -
  \vec{B}_\delta
  \left[0 \quad k_{\dot{\phi}} \quad 0 \quad 0\right]
\right)
  \vec{x} + \mathbf{B} \begin{bmatrix} T_{\phi} \\ T_\delta^\textrm{h}
\end{bmatrix}
  \textrm{.}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The state matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>
being a function of the equilibrium speed <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> means the control gain <span
class="math inline">\(k_{\dot{\phi}}\)</span> can be selected such that
the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\left(\mathbf{A} -
\vec{B}_\delta\left[0 \quad k_{\dot{\phi}}
\quad 0 \quad 0\right] \right)\)</span> have negative real parts for
<span class="math inline">\(v_{min} &lt; v &lt;
v_\textrm{capsize}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(v_{min}\)</span> is the lowest stable speed given
<span class="math inline">\(k_{\dot{\phi}}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v_\textrm{capsize}\)</span> is the speed at which
the uncontrolled bicycle’s capsize mode goes unstable. By gain
scheduling with respect to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, the
speed range where the bicycle is stable can be maximized within any
physical actuator magnitude and bandwidth limits. Schwab, Kooijman, and
Meijaard <span class="citation" data-cites="Schwab2008">(Schwab,
Kooijman, and Meijaard 2008)</span> elaborate on some of the
possibilities in scheduling the gains for such a controller for a
bicycle and show that linear scheduling with respect to speed can give
satisfactory stability for a low speed range. We use this simple
feedback principle as the basis for our balance assist controller.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<h2 id="bicycle">Bicycle</h2>
<p>We modified a Grenoble C8 HMB electric bicycle (Royal Dutch Gazelle,
Dieren, The Netherlands) with a custom motor in the steering assembly
capable of applying up to 7 N m of torque between the head tube and
steer tube, see Figure <a href="#fig:balance-assist-bicycle"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:balance-assist-bicycle">1</a>. A custom motor
controller converts the commanded torque to applied torque. We measure
the speed of the rear wheel with a DF30 Speed Sensor (Bosch eBike
Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) and measure the body fixed roll rate of
the bicycle with a VR IMU BN0086 MEMs rate gyroscope (Sparkfun, Niwot,
USA). The balance assist control algorithm is implemented on a Teensy
microprocessor (PJRC, Sherwood, USA) and data from all sensors is logged
with a CanEdge2 CAN bus (CSS Electronics, Aabyhøj, Denmark) at at least
100 Hz.</p>
<h2 id="balance-assist-control">Balance Assist Control</h2>
<p>We use a forward speed <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> gain
scheduled proportional roll angular rate feedback controller to
stabilize the bicycle. In the speed range tested, the commanded steer
torque <span class="math inline">\(T^\textrm{m}_\delta\)</span> from the
steer motor follows the control law <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  T^\textrm{m}_\delta = -k_{\dot{\phi}}\dot{\phi} = \kappa(v_{stable} -
v)\dot{\phi}
  \label{eq:implemented-controller}
\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(v_{\textrm{stable}} =
4.7~\si{\meter\per\second}\)</span> is approximately the average stable
speed predicted from the open-loop bicycle rigid-rider dynamics. We use
the gain factor <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=3.9\)</span> (low)
and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=5.2\)</span> (high) to tune the
gain magnitude during the experiments. Figure <a href="#fig:eigenvalues"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:eigenvalues">2</a> shows
the stabilization effect of the controller via the eigenmodes of the
linear system. Geometric and inertial parameters for these plots were
estimated with the methods presented in <span class="citation"
data-cites="Moore2012">(Moore 2012)</span> and software packages
BicycleParameters 1.1.1 <span class="citation"
data-cites="Moore2024">(Moore et al. 2011)</span> and Yeadon 1.5.0 <span
class="citation" data-cites="Dembia2015">(Dembia, Moore, and Hubbard
2015)</span> and are shown in Appendix <a
href="#sec:physical-parameters" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:physical-parameters">6</a>.</p>
<p>For the 6 km h<sup>−1</sup> experiment, scaling the proportional
feedback gain linearly with respect to speed stabilizes the normally
unstable weave mode of the bicycle down to 3.4 km h<sup>−1</sup> for the
riderless bicycle and 8.0 km h<sup>−1</sup> for the ridden bicycle. For
the 10 km h<sup>−1</sup> experiment, it stabilizes the normally unstable
weave mode of the bicycle down to 3.8 km h<sup>−1</sup> for the
riderless bicycle and 9.7 km h<sup>−1</sup> for the ridden bicycle as
shown in Figure <a href="#fig:eigenvalues" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:eigenvalues">2</a>. Notably, the controlled bicycle
is not stable at 6 km h<sup>−1</sup> but the time constant of the
unstable eigenvalue is increased by a factor of eight and at
10 km h<sup>−1</sup> the system is just stable. Figure <a
href="#fig:eigenvalues" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:eigenvalues">2</a> also shows the identified weave
mode captured using the methods of Kooijman et al. <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kooijman2009a">(Kooijman and Schwab
2009)</span> and gives an indication of the performance of the system,
with the model predicting the weave mode well in the region of the
tested speeds.</p>

<h2 id="perturbations">Perturbations</h2>
<p>We apply longitudinal forces to the ends of each handlebar from
earth-fixed posts using an adapted Bump’Em system <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tan2020">(Tan, Raitor, and Collins 2020)</span> which we
arrange with four EC-90 Flat motors (Maxon Group, Switzerland) working
in cooperation, Figure <a href="#fig:setup-diagram"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:setup-diagram">[fig:setup-diagram]</a>. The four
motors are programmed to apply a light force at all times to keep the
ropes taught and to track a commanded force profile using a PID
controller running on an Arduino Mega 2560 microprocessor (Arduino,
Italy). We measure the force applied by each motor at the handlebar via
four inline S-style load cells (Bosche GmbH, Damme, Germany). All were
rated for 250 N except the left rear load cell which was rated for
500 N. The commanded force profiles are designed to apply an external
pulsive torque to the front frame at magnitudes varying from
16 N m–160 N m. The four motors are arranged at the four corners of a
1 m wide by 2 m long treadmill (Bonte Technology B.V., Zwolle, The
Netherlands) that can reach speeds up to 18 km h<sup>−1</sup>. The
general design of this perturbation system is described in detail in Van
De Velde’s MSc thesis <span class="citation"

<h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2>
<p>We recruited 26 able-bodied young adults between 20 and 36 years old
(mean of 25 years) to participate in the experiments. The participants
were all confident in their cycling skills and had cycled at least once
in the last month. All participants consented to the experiment and
could decline to continue at any time. The study was approved by Delft
University of Technology’s Human Research Ethics Council (record #3897).
The participants were divided into two groups. The first group of
fifteen participants performed the protocol at a belt speed of
10 km h<sup>−1</sup>(2.8 m s<sup>−1</sup>) with the gain factor set to
<span class="math inline">\(\kappa=3.9\)</span> and two weeks later the
second group of eleven participants performed the protocol at a belt
speed of 6 km h<sup>−1</sup> (1.7 m s<sup>−1</sup>) with the gain factor
set to <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=5.2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Participants wore a helmet and they were attached to the ceiling via
a fall safety harness, Figure <a href="#fig:participant-in-set-up"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:participant-in-set-up">[fig:participant-in-set-up]</a>.
The harness allowed natural free movement pre-fall. The participants
practiced falling in the harness at least once and then practiced riding
on the treadmill until they indicated they were comfortable enough to
have perturbations applied. For most, this was less than a 10 min warm
up. We then asked the rider to ride for 90 s, while attempting to
maintain the location of their front wheel on the center line of the
treadmill as a baseline measure before the perturbations. We then
applied perturbations in random directions (clockwise or
counter-clockwise), starting at 20 N and increasing the magnitude by
30 N until the participants fell. We defined a “fall” on the treadmill
by two criteria: 1) the rider removes their foot from the pedal and
places it on the ground or 2) the bicycle wheel exceeds the width of the
treadmill belt. These two fall criteria are not strictly the same and
the latter is more likely to happen at higher speeds. We informed the
participants beforehand that we would stop the treadmill in these
situations. These were the two actions which necessitated stopping the
treadmill belt and they are proxies for real fall modes. Placing a foot
down on the fall side of the bicycle is a natural reaction when steering
or other body movements are not sufficient to keep the bicycle upright,
as shown in <span class="citation" data-cites="Gildea2024">(Gildea et
al. 2024)</span>. Exiting the width of the treadmill is akin to exiting
the width of a curb-less bicycle path and arises when the rider’s
control actions are not sufficient to correct the heading of the vehicle
in sufficient time. Figure <a href="#fig:perturbation-sequence"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:perturbation-sequence">[fig:perturbation-sequence]</a>
shows an example resulting motion from a perturbation. We logged the
force magnitude that caused the first fall to characterize that
participant’s <em>perturbation resistance threshold</em>.</p>
<p><span><img src="figures/start.png" style="width:60mm"

<span><img src="figures/recovery.png" style="width:60mm"
alt="image" /></span></p>
<p>Following the initial threshold determination where the participant
experienced a range of perturbation magnitudes, we then choose
perturbation forces according to a random and adaptive staircase
procedure applying perturbations above and below the initial
perturbation threshold, while allowing small progression of the
perturbation threshold to accommodate learning effects. We did not try
to eliminate learning effects due to the time per participant that would
be required, but factored this into the later statistical analysis. Five
possible perturbation forces are determined based on the initial
perturbation threshold estimate: the initial estimate itself, two
perturbations lower than the initial estimate, and two perturbations
higher than the initial estimate. The five possible perturbations are
separated by 10 N steps. For example, if the initial estimate of the
perturbation threshold of a participant is 80 N, the five possible
perturbations are 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 N. Which one of these five
perturbations is chosen first is determined at random. If the
perturbation results in a fall, the estimate of the perturbation
threshold is decreased by 10 N, and vice versa if the perturbation did
not result in a fall. Five new possible perturbation forces are
determined around the updated perturbation threshold, and a new
perturbation is selected at random. This process iterates until twenty
perturbations are applied. The sense of the perturbation was randomized
within the 20 perturbations. The goal of this adaptive staircase
procedure is to have participants fall for approximately 50% of the
time. After the first set of 20 perturbations, we let the cyclist rest
and then perform another 20 perturbations. We randomize whether the
balance assist system is on or off during the first or second set of 20
perturbations for each participant and the participants were not told
the order.</p>
<h2 id="measurements">Measurements</h2>

forces and the bicycle’s steer angle <span

</figure>
<p>Based on our prior findings from measuring riders without balance
assist <span class="citation" data-cites="Haitjema2023a">(M. T. Haitjema
2023)</span>, we calculate several variables that we hypothesize may
influence fall probability. We use the angular impulse <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> of the perturbation forces over a 0.3 s
duration to characterize the magnitude of delivered perturbation. The
duration is selected based on the duration of the commanded perturbation
force and is calculated as follows: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  L =
  \int_{0\si{\second}}^{0.3\si{\second}} \frac{l}{2}\left(F_r +
F_l\right) dt
  =
  \int_{0\si{\second}}^{0.3\si{\second}} \frac{l}{2}\left[\left(F_{rf} -
    F_{rr}\right) + \left(F_{lf} - F_{lr}\right)\right] dt
  \label{eq:angular-impulse}
\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(F_r\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(F_l\)</span> is the total force applied
on the right and left handlebar ends, respectively which are the sum of
the rear and front load cell readings <span
class="math inline">\(F_{rr}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F_{rf}\)</span>, for example. The handlebar length
is given as <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> in Equation <a
href="#eq:angular-impulse" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:angular-impulse">[eq:angular-impulse]</a>. We use
angular impulse instead of peak torque to normalize for the duration of
the applied perturbation to capture the total effect of the perturbation
pulse.</p>
<p>We record the order number of each perturbation <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, i.e. first, second, third, …, to
measure how many perturbations a rider is subjected to before the
current perturbation. At the initiation of each perturbation we log the
instantaneous steer and roll angles, <span
class="math inline">\(\delta_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span>, to characterize the configuration
of the bicycle when perturbed. The sense of these variables relative to
the sense of the perturbation matters. For example, if there is already
a large steer angle in the same direction as the perturbation, this will
have a different effect on the probability that a fall will occur than
if the steer angle is in the opposite direction of the perturbation. To
account for this, the roll and steer variables at the instance of
perturbation are normalized for perturbation direction as was done in
<span class="citation" data-cites="Haitjema2023a">(M. T. Haitjema
2023)</span>. The gain factor setting on the balance assist controller
indicates if the assistance is off <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa=0\)</span> or on at two different levels:
low <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=3.9\)</span> or high <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa=5.2\)</span>. As mentioned earlier, a
recovery from the perturbation is successful if the person neither
places their foot down onto the treadmill surface nor the wheel of the
bicycle exits the width of the treadmill belt. We record this as a
binary variable <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> for “fall”. All
measured variables are reported in Table <a href="#tab:raw"

data-reference="eq:log-regress">[eq:log-regress]</a>, that represents
the probability of this binary outcome. The log-odds of the probability

<p>Due to data quality issues that prevented time synchronization of the
measurements, we excluded one participant from the 6 km h<sup>−1</sup>
dataset and one from the 10 km h<sup>−1</sup> dataset, leaving 24
participants for the analysis. Before fitting the model, we scale each
independent variable <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}^k\)</span> such
that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one by
cluster-mean centering with clusters being an individual participant, as
recommended by <span class="citation" data-cites="Enders2007">(Enders
and Tofighi 2007)</span>. The clusters are chosen as all data from an
individual participant because we are only interested in the association
between the state of the balance assist system and the outcome of the
perturbation for that participant, not how participants perform relative
to each other. We expected there to be variation between participants in
how well they are able to resist the perturbation; however, this was not
true. If a random effect is included in the model for each participant,
the intraclass correlation (ICC) is less than 3% for both the
6 km h<sup>−1</sup> and 10 km h<sup>−1</sup> datasets, so we utilize a
simple single-level logistic regression model without the random effect
instead of a multilevel model. This tracks with the independent data
collected in <span class="citation" data-cites="Haitjema2023a">(M. T.
Haitjema 2023)</span> which also had negligible participant variation.
This left us with angular impulse, perturbation order, balance assist
state, and roll &amp; steer angles at the time of perturbation as
independent variables. We also include interaction effects between the
balance assist state and the other four variables. We divide the
analysis into two separate model evaluations, one for the
6 km h<sup>−1</sup>, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=5.2\)</span>
trials and one for the 10 km h<sup>−1</sup>, <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa=3.9\)</span> trials and we evaluate our
hypothesis for each set of data. Statistics were computed with R version
4.1.3 <span class="citation" data-cites="RCoreTeam2021">(R Core Team

<p>Turning the balance assist system on significantly <span
class="math inline">\((p=0.02&lt;0.05)\)</span> reduces the odds that a
perturbation results in a fall while cycling at a speed of
6 km h<sup>−1</sup>. Figure <a href="#fig:probability-6kph"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:probability-6kph">[fig:probability-6kph]</a>
visualizes the probability of falling as a function of the mean and
centered angular impulse per participant for the balance assist state on
and off. This figure is created by setting all explanatory variables to
their centered mean values and calculating the probability from
Equation <a href="#eq:log-regress" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:log-regress">[eq:log-regress]</a> for only change in
angular impulse given the estimates in Table <a href="#tab:freq-coefs-6"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:freq-coefs-6">3</a>. The
table indicates that the balance assist system halves (0.53) the odds
that a perturbation results in a fall. This figure shows that for
relatively large impulses the probability to fall is unity for both
states of balance assist on and off. And for relatively small impulses
the probability to fall is null for both states. But for impulses in the
magnitude region (about -1 to 0.5 STD), i.e. around the mean-centered
perturbation resistance threshold, the probability of falling is
significantly lowered with the balance assist system on. The skewness of
the probability curves arrives from the interaction effects. Figure <a
href="#fig:probability-10kph" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:probability-10kph">[fig:probability-10kph]</a> shows
the same result for the 10 km h<sup>−1</sup> trials which has a similar
trend of reducing the probability to fall with the balance assist system
turned on, but the effect is not significant <span

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>We have shown that at a 6 km h<sup>−1</sup> riding speed the addition
of balance assist control reduces the chance that a rider will fall when
perturbed around the limits of their control authority. But this effect
diminishes just below significance at the higher speed scenario of
10 km h<sup>−1</sup>. We were only able to test these two speed-gain
scenarios for mostly homogeneous sets of riders within the resources of
this research project, but additional experimental work could help
understand more completely the range and limits of the positive effect
of the balance assist system. For example, it is possible that simply
increasing the controller gain factor at 10 km h<sup>−1</sup> also
results in a significant positive effect. A longitudinal study of normal
use of the balance assist bicycle compared to a control group could
provide the strongest evidence of any benefit we have seen in this
specific scenario.</p>
<h2 id="stability-and-human-controlled-plant-dynamics">Stability and
Human Controlled Plant Dynamics</h2>
<p>The linear Carvallo-Whipple model indicates that the steer controller
stabilizes the bicycle-rider system, but this model assumes the rider’s
hands are not connected to the handlebars and that they clamp their body
as rigidly as possible to the rear frame. In reality, the system’s
behavior is likely more akin to a marginally stable or an easily
controllable unstable system due to the various un-modeled effects. Our
system may not result in a definitely stable system, i.e. cannot fall,
but having plant eigenvalues with very small unstable eigenvalue real
parts correlates to ease of control <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hess2012">(Hess, Moore, and Hubbard 2012)</span> which can
be beneficial for avoiding falls.</p>
<p>The controller design we utilize, Equation <a
href="#eq:implemented-controller" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:implemented-controller">[eq:implemented-controller]</a>,
also increases the weave mode frequency by a factor of about three to
almost 1 Hz. This bandwidth is still controllable by the human’s
neuromuscular system <span class="citation"
data-cites="Magdaleno1971">(Magdaleno and McRuer 1971)</span>, but may
feel unusual as it is more akin to what the steering would feel like at
25 km h<sup>−1</sup> for a normal bicycle. Hanakam, Wehner, and
Wrede <span class="citation" data-cites="Hanakam2023">(Hanakam, Wehner,
and Wrede 2023)</span> reported dissatisfaction in subjective rider
feeling on their similar bicycle to ours and this high frequency effect
to the human-controlled plant dynamics could be an explanation to their
findings.</p>
<h2 id="utility-of-the-logistic-model-to-natural-falls">Utility of the
Logistic Model to Natural Falls</h2>
<p>The probability that a fall occurs depends on the values of all the
independent variables in Table <a href="#tab:stat-model-variables"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:stat-model-variables">2</a>, but we can visualize
the effect of one or two variables (e.g. Figure <a
href="#fig:probability" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:probability">[fig:probability]</a>) to gain some
insight. To interpret the results in Tables <a href="#tab:freq-coefs-6"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:freq-coefs-6">3</a> and <a
href="#tab:freq-coefs-10" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:freq-coefs-10">4</a> it is important to understand
the relationship between probability and odds. The estimate in Table <a
href="#tab:freq-coefs-6" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:freq-coefs-6">3</a> shows that the balance assist
system halves the odds that a perturbation results in a fall: <span
class="math inline">\(e^{\alpha_k}=0.53\)</span>. This means if the odds
are a 1000:1, turning on the balance assist system reduces the odds to
500:1. However, in that case the probability that a fall occurs is only
reduced from <span class="math inline">\(0.999\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(0.998\)</span>. If the odds that a fall occurs are
smaller, halving the odds has a larger influence on the fall
probability. For example, if the odds that a fall occurs is two, halving
it to one reduces the probability from <span
class="math inline">\(0.66\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(0.50\)</span>. This can be seen in Figure <a
href="#fig:probability" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:probability">[fig:probability]</a> which shows the
fall probability as a function of the magnitude of the normalized
angular impulse for both speeds. The difference in probability between
the balance assist on/off case becomes insignificant outside of
approximately <span class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span> standard
deviation of the average angular impulse the rider was subjected to.
This means that the balance assist is most effective for perturbations
close to the participant’s perturbation resistance threshold and that
large perturbations will make you fall regardless of the balance assist
system’s help.</p>
<p>To illustrate the effect of the balance assist system on fall
probability, we will give an example of how the data collected during
the experiments is used to predict fall probability. We use Equation <a
href="#eq:log-regress" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:log-regress">[eq:log-regress]</a> and the
coefficients in Table <a href="#tab:freq-coefs-6"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:freq-coefs-6">3</a>. For
simplicity’s sake, the interaction effects are not included. For
example, assuming that the mean angular impulse <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{L}\)</span> of all the perturbations applied
to a participant is 100 N and the standard deviation <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{L}=15\)</span>. The centered and scaled
angular impulse can be calculated by subtracting <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{L}\)</span> from the applied angular impulse
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and dividing this by <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{L}\)</span>. The same applies for the
perturbation order <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, initial roll
angle <span class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span>, and initial steer
angle <span class="math inline">\(\delta_0\)</span>. If we take the
coefficients estimated for cycling at 6 km h<sup>−1</sup> and example
means, the log-odds of falling can be calculated as follows: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    \log \left( \frac{P_{ij}}{1-P_{ij}} \right)
    = &amp; \quad
    \beta + \sum_{k=1}^{k=5}\alpha_k
\frac{x_{ij}^{k}-\bar{x}_{ij}^{k}}{\sigma^{x^{k}}} \\
    = &amp;
   -0.29 + 1.69\cdot\frac{110~\si{\newton} -
100\si{\newton}}{15\si{\newton}} -0.77\cdot\frac{10-20}{11.54}  \\
    &amp; -0.25\cdot\frac{-6\si{\degree}-2\si{\degree}}{10\si{\degree}}
    -0.14\cdot\frac{1\si{\degree}+3\si{\degree}}{5\si{\degree}} -0.64 s
\\
    = &amp;
    1.59 -0.64 s
  \textrm{.}
  \end{split}\]</span> The state of the balance assist <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is a binary variable. If the balance
assist is turned on, the log-odds that a fall occurs are decreased by
0.64. The odds and probability can be calculated: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \frac{P_{ij}}{1-P_{ij}} &amp; = e^{1.59-0.64s} =
  e^{1.59}\cdot e^{-0.64s} = 4.90 \cdot e^{-0.64s} \\
  P_{ij}|_{s=0} &amp; = \frac{4.90}{1 + 4.90} = 0.83 \\
  P_{ij}|_{s=1} &amp; = \frac{4.90\cdot0.53}{1 + 4.90\cdot{0.53}} = 0.72
\end{aligned}\]</span> Turning on the balance assist system reduces the
probability that the perturbation results in a fall from 83% to 72% in
this case.</p>
<p>This illustration alludes to the difficulty needed to apply the model
in way that could predict how many falls may be averted in a natural
setting if the balance assist system is used. Estimates of the predictor
variables extracted from the limited data collected from natural cycling
would be needed to populate the model. The positive effect of the
balance assist system is coupled to the assumptions and experimental
scenarios we implemented and there is unfortunately no simple way to
extrapolate our results to reductions of single-actor crashes we may see
if such a system were deployed widely to bicyclists. Although, our
results do indicate that we would see such a reduction, even if only in
a class of single-actor crashes that most resemble our experimental
design. If there were more comprehensive and detailed natural data of
how people fall we could make estimates on the number of falls reduced
if everyone rode a balance assist bicycle.</p>
<h2 id="treadmill-width">Treadmill Width</h2>
<p>Angular impulse magnitude has the largest significant effect for
predicting fall probability as seen in both Tables <a
href="#tab:freq-coefs-6" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:freq-coefs-6">3</a> and <a href="#tab:freq-coefs-10"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:freq-coefs-10">4</a>. An
increase in angular impulse increases the fall probability both at 6 and
10 km h<sup>−1</sup>. At 10 km h<sup>−1</sup>, the multiplicative change
in odds is approximately twice as big as at 6 km h<sup>−1</sup>. Thus,
angular impulse is a more important predictor at higher speeds compared
to lower speeds. We posit that this likely has to do with the width of
the treadmill and that this could also be why the balance assist system
did not have a statistically significant effect at 10 km h<sup>−1</sup>.
As a bicycle travels at higher speeds, the same perturbation magnitude
causes larger lateral deviations. At 10 km h<sup>−1</sup>, almost all
falls were due to the bicycle exiting the maximum width of the
treadmill. If the same experiment was performed on an infinitely wide
plane, the riders may have recovered from more perturbations. At
6 km h<sup>−1</sup>, the riders could often recover in the allotted
treadmill width due to the smaller lateral deviations. We believe our
results are very much dependent on the two modes of falling, i.e.
exiting the treadmill width or placing a foot on the belt. Future
studies should consider coding fall mode by type. On the other hand,
cycle paths are a similar width as the treadmill, so riders are often
limited in width when recovering from a fall thus exiting the treadmill
width may be an appropriate measure for indicating a fall. While the
treadmill simulates narrow cycle paths, real-world paths may offer more
lateral recovery space, providing riders with additional opportunities
to regain balance after a perturbation. However, testing in such narrow
conditions is still highly relevant, as system design and validation
should focus on extreme conditions like narrow paths, because even in
wider paths obstacles such as parked cars or barriers can limit lateral
space.</p>
<h2 id="rider-skill-and-experience">Rider Skill and Experience</h2>
<p>Each individual participant had their own perturbation resistance
threshold, i.e. the perturbation magnitude defining whether they would
fall 50% of the time. The value of this threshold is likely correlated
with the skill and experience of the participant at balancing a bicycle.
With this study, we cannot answer whether the balance assist system
helps low skilled participants more than highly skilled participants
because that is simply a function of how often a perturbation in a
natural setting exceeds an individual’s threshold. But, we did find that
the system can help regardless of a participant’s individual balance
performance. On average, the balance assist system pushes the
perturbation resistance threshold up for all participants. The vast
majority of perturbations experienced in natural bicycling are below an
individual’s perturbation resistance threshold, otherwise we would
observe bicyclists falling much more, but low skilled riders may
experience more perturbations that exceed their threshold. Determining
how often certain perturbation types and magnitudes are experienced in
natural bicycling is an open research need and would help understand
whether a balance assist intervention would have a strong effect when
used in the wild.</p>
<h2 id="learning-effect">Learning Effect</h2>
<p>An increase in the number of perturbations that a participant already
experienced, decreases the probability that a fall occurs. This is
likely due to the participants learning how to better recover from the
perturbation over the duration of the experiment. This effect is
significant at both 6 and 10 km h<sup>−1</sup> and in the same order of
magnitude. This suggests that the learning effect that occurs during the
experiment is not strongly dependent on the speed but that similar
experiments should consider the learning effect. An experiment that
tests professional cyclists or one that trains each participant to their
maximum performance could be insightful.</p>
<h2 id="non-significant-predictors">Non-significant Predictors</h2>
<p>Roll and steer angle at the initiation of a perturbation are not a
significant predictor of fall probability at 6 or at
10 km h<sup>−1</sup>. We expected these variables to have a significant
effect based on the following reasoning. If you are in a rolled and
steered state that is far from the upright equilibrium, then a
perturbation that further pushes you from the equilibrium should have
some additive or multiplicative effect on the resulting motion
trajectory and make it harder to recover from a fall, but our results
did not confirm this reasoning and we do not yet understand why.</p>
<p>None of the interaction effects are statistically significant. That
means that whether the balance assist system is on or off does not
significantly change the effect that the roll angle, steer angle,
angular impulse, and perturbation order have on the probability that a
fall will occur.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Automatically controlling a steering motor in a bicycle using roll
rate feedback lowers the speed at which the bicycle is stable. This
makes the bicycle’s low speed dynamics more akin to its uncontrolled
high speed dynamics, which is easier for a rider to control in balance.
Perturbation forces applied to the handlebar can cause a rider to fall
and every rider has a perturbation resistance threshold at which they
are more likely to fall than not. The probability of falling when
mechanically perturbed is significantly (<span
class="math inline">\(p=0.02\)</span>) reduced when traveling at
6 km h<sup>−1</sup> when the balance assisting control is activated.
This effect is present when traveling at 10 km h<sup>−1</sup> and is
very close to significance (<span class="math inline">\(p=0.07\)</span>)
but more investigation is needed to determine if the effect can be
significant. The positive effect to balance is rider independent and
most effective in the regime of perturbations near the limits of the
rider’s control authority. Given that similar effects cause falls during
bicycling, use of the balance assist system in real world use cases
should reduce the number of falls at low bicycling speeds.</p>
